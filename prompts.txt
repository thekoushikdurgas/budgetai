refreactor my whole flutter app named 'budgetai' app to complete my app run and mantained the file readme.md 

read my flutter codebase that name 'budgetai' and edit or refractor as my prompts  and mantained the file readme.md 

read the terminal ther are errors to completly solved  my app step by step and then finally the run the app

HOW I set a monthly salary budget with an AI suggestion app to distribute the salary and how much I can spend every day for months by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'budgetai'  and mantained the file readme.md 

also, add a calendar to show how daily and monthly total spending and how much to spend exits or when it is good give me suggestions by ai by r reading by spends by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'budgetai'  and mantained the file readme.md 

also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details to read salary also read every day spends every where and saved every spend saved in mongodb by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'budgetai'  and mantained the file readme.md 

as AI use openrouter models flutter pub add dart_openai import 'package:dart_openai/dart_openai.dart'; import 'env/env.dart'; Future<void> main() async { // Set the OpenAI API key from the .env file. OpenAI.apiKey = Env.apiKey; // Start using! final completion = await OpenAI.instance.completion.create( model: "text-davinci-003", prompt: "Dart is", ); // Printing the output to the console print(completion.choices[0].text); // Generate an image from a prompt. final image = await OpenAI.instance.image.create( prompt: "dog", n: 1, ); // Printing the output to the console. for (int index = 0; index < image.data.length; index++) { final currentItem = image.data[index]; print(currentItem.url); } // create a moderation final moderation = await OpenAI.instance.moderation.create( input: "I will cut your head off", ); // Printing moderation print(moderation.results.first.categories.violence); } import OpenAI from 'openai'; const openai = new OpenAI({ baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1', apiKey: '<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>', defaultHeaders: { 'HTTP-Referer': '<YOUR_SITE_URL>', // Optional.

also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details analysis by AI openrouter model to read salary also read every day spends everywhere and saved every spend saved in mongodb

design this like it every read unread SMS and tracks all Transactions and updated the exist statement it add then show in dashboard

so in-app 'budgetai' there are 4 tabs
1. The dashboard tab designed like it every reads unread SMS and tracks all Transaction and updated the exist statement it add then shows in dashboard see in progress bar and when new Transactions are added statement it has two buttons yes or no
2. also add a tab to show all SMS in mobile and all SMS are converted to Transactions tracks all statement see in progress bar and when new Transactions add in statement it two buttons yes or no also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details to read salary also read every day spends every where and saved every spend saved in mongodb by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'budgetai'  and mantained the file readme.md also read SMS in mobile to read credit or debit details analysis by AI openrouter model to read salary also read every day spends everywhere and saved every spend saved in mongodb


To integrate OpenRouter's free models into your flutter app "budgetai" and add a dropdown for selecting free models in the settings page, follow this implementation plan using the provided knowledge base:

---

### 1. Fetch Free Models from OpenRouter API
Use the OpenRouter `/models` endpoint to list all models and filter for free ones [[2]][[8]]:  
```javascript
// services/openrouter.js
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';


export async function fetchFreeModels() {
  try {
    const response = await openai.models.list(); // GET /models [[2]]
    // Filter free models (e.g., those with ":free" suffix or price=0)
    return response.data.filter(model => 
      model.id.includes(':free') || model.pricing?.input === 0
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch models:", error);
    return [];
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Settings Page UI with Model Dropdown
Create a `SettingsScreen` with a dropdown to select models using `react-native-dropdown-picker` [[6]]:  
```javascript
// screens/SettingsScreen.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import DropDownPicker from 'react-native-dropdown-picker';
import { fetchFreeModels } from '../services/openrouter';

const SettingsScreen = () => {
  const [models, setModels] = useState([]);
  const [selectedModel, setSelectedModel] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch and format models on load
    fetchFreeModels().then(fetchedModels => {
      setModels(fetchedModels.map(model => ({
        label: model.name || model.id,
        value: model.id,
      })));
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Select Free Model:</Text>
      <DropDownPicker
        items={models}
        value={selectedModel}
        onChangeItem={item => setSelectedModel(item.value)}
        placeholder="Choose a model"
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default SettingsScreen;
```

---

### 3. Use Selected Model in AI Requests
Pass the selected model ID to your AI service [[1]][[5]]:  
```javascript
// services/ai.js
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';


export async function getAIResponse(prompt, selectedModel) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: selectedModel, // Use the user-selected model
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  });
  return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

---

### 4. Key Implementation Notes
- Free Model Filtering:  
  OpenRouter labels free models with suffixes like `:free` (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free`) [[7]][[8]].  
- Error Handling:  
  Add loading states and error messages for network failures [[9]].  
- Persistent Storage:  
  Save the selected model to `AsyncStorage` to persist user preferences [[4]].  

---

### 5. Example Workflow
1. Settings Page: User selects a free model (e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite`).  
2. AI Interaction: The selected model is used for all chat/completion requests [[5]][[6]].  

By integrating this dropdown, "budgetai" users can dynamically choose free OpenRouter models for budgeting insights while minimizing costs.
3. also, add a tab to show calendar to show how daily and monthly total spending and how much to spend exits or when it is good to give me suggestions by ai by r reading by spends by Ai in refractor flutter that named 'budgetai'  and maintained the file 
4.  for the settings tab
